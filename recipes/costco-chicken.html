    <h3>Description: It's chicken from costco</h3>

        <img src='../img/costco-chicken.jpeg' alt='Chicken, in a bag, per the style of the times' style="width:80;height:45;">
        <ol>
            <li>Remove chicken from bag and place on cutting board</li>
            <li>Remove string, don't forget this part or you <em>will</em> be sorry!</li>
            <li>Begin by nicely cutting a slice of chicken from the top of the breast</li>
            <li>Carefully avoid bones and get a nice sliver of that skin on there</li>
            <li><strong>Careful!</strong> don't mess it up, no one likes messy food!</li>
            <li>Realize you don't have time or patience to cut this sucker up nicely</li>
            <li>Begin to tear off chunks, dip in hot sauce, wing sauce, salsa, ranch... anything you got handy</li>
            <li>Continue until the hunger of the beast is sated, about an eighth to a whole chicken</li>
        </ol>
        <h6>Eat it straight out of the bag with your hands because you're a true heathen</h6>
