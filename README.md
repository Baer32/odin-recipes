# odin-recipes
I have no idea what to write here.

I guess this is supposed to be a website with recipe links?
It's an odd format to write this up before really knowing
anything about the project, but whatever, trust the method.

I hope to learn to code better and have a basis for robust projects 
in my github account.
I really want to use this to get better at coding but more so...
I NEED A GOOD JOB!
