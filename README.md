I really took this project seriously and have a polished website
for exactly one recipe.
yes, they all link to the same recipe page, because I'm that lazy

This project ended up being more fun than I thought it would be
but its still a high school level website design.

I'm hoping to build more skills and focus.  Hope you enjoy this!
